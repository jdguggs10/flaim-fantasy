# Analyze Matchup

Assess the user's current head-to-head matchup with a fact-based forecast of what remains.

## Scope and data rules

- Fantasy league data must come from Flaim MCP tools.
- Use web search for live schedule context, injury updates, probable starters, and remaining real-world games.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` is the requested matchup week.
- If no argument is provided, use the current week.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve the target league

- Reuse a usable successful `get_user_session` result from this chat. Call it if that context is missing, after a successful league refresh, or when the user confirms account, connection, league-list, or default changes. Do not repeat it just for a follow-up or a switch to another league already in the session result. Follow the tool's error guidance if a lookup fails.
- If the user explicitly names a league, platform, or sport, honor that.
- Otherwise treat this as a vague singular request: use `defaultLeague` when present, otherwise the relevant sport entry in `defaultLeagues`.
- If there is no applicable default and multiple leagues still match, ask which league.
- Call `get_league_info` for the selected league before matchup analysis so team names, scoring type, owner/team mapping, and roster context are resolved.

### 2. Determine whether matchup analysis applies

Use `get_league_info` to identify scoring format:

- **H2H Points**: proceed
- **H2H Categories**: proceed
- **Roto or any other non-H2H format**: explain that this skill only applies to head-to-head leagues and offer standings or roster analysis instead.

### 3. Pull matchup and roster context

- Call `get_matchups` using `$ARGUMENTS` as the requested week, or the current week if no argument was provided
- Identify the opponent's `team_id` from the matchup data before fetching their roster
- Call `get_roster` for the user's team
- Call `get_roster` for the opponent using that `team_id`

### 4. Determine what remains to be played

Use web search to establish remaining real-world volume:

- **Football**: identify which players have already played, are in progress, or still have games left; group remaining players by game slot
- **Baseball/Basketball/Hockey**: estimate remaining player-games for both rosters
- For baseball, include probable remaining starts when current information supports it

### 5. Assess the matchup state

For **H2H Points**:

- state the current score and margin
- list meaningful remaining players and game windows
- explain whether the matchup looks comfortable, tight, or uphill
- flag high-variance swing factors

For **H2H Categories**:

- state the current category record
- separate likely-locked categories from realistic swing categories
- explain where remaining volume could still flip the matchup

### 6. Present the briefing

Format the output as:

- a clean score line at the top
- remaining-player or remaining-volume sections for both teams
- a short outlook paragraph covering trajectory, volatility, and what to watch

## Output style

- Keep it analytical, not melodramatic
- Do not recommend roster moves in this skill
- Focus on scoreboard state, remaining volume, and likely swing factors
